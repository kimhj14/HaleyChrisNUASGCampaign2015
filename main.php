    <h1>We believe in Northwestern</h1>
    <p class="lead">Over the last three years, we’ve worked to build up all aspects of Northwestern by bringing students and communities together because we believe that we can achieve more together than we can as individuals. <a name="video"></a>We believe that students should be supported above all else, and that when we build up each other, we build up our whole community. We believe in a Northwestern where student wellness is a priority, where inclusive community is a reality, and where students groups have the resources they need to succeed.</p>

    <h2><a href="about.php">ABOUT</a></h2>
    <p>Through our campus experiences, we’ve served as student representatives, advocates for campus safety and student wellness, ambassadors to the broader community, event organizers, and mentors to younger leaders. In each role, we acted with the mindset that we are stronger together; that ASG is a partner to connect students, support groups, and build up community.</p>

    <h2><a href="vision.php">WHY US</a></h2>
    <p>We’re uniquely suited to serve and lead the student body because we have experience making real progress and tangible wins. Our leadership style and friendship has come from years of working together to organize events, improve transportation, and make campus a safer community. Where others can only promise to achieve progress for you, we already have a proven track record of working with others to Build Up Student Wellness; Inclusive Community; Student Groups, and much more.</p>
