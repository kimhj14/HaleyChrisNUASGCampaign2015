			<p>Over the last four months, we’ve spent more than 200 hours in conversation with students to develop these ideas. They’ve been revised countless times, and we’re proud to present them to you now.</p>
			
			<p>This is our commitment to you. It’s ambitious, but our extensive experience and significant research (with peer institutions, with administrators, and with students) tells us it can be accomplished. In fact, we’ve already started.</p> 
			
			<p>We’ve been working together for years making real strides to achieve wins for our peers. We’re excited to use those experiences and the ideas below to join with students and Build Up: Northwestern. Please join us. </p>

				<h1><a class="roll-link" name="mentalhealth">Build Up: Student Wellness</a></h1>
				<h3>Academic Stress</h3>
				<li>Northwestern requires more credits to graduate than any of its quarter system peers. We will advocate for a reevaluation of credit requirements in all six schools. Most immediately, we believe that the number of Weinberg graduation requirements should be reduced from 45 to 42 credits in order to decrease stress and increase academic flexibility.</li>
				<br>
				<h3>Mental Wellness</h3>
				<li>Faculty and staff often fail to recognize the academic and extracurricular burdens students face. Our university should prioritize student wellness, and the first of many steps would be to adopt a practice from UChicago by cancelling class one day each Winter Quarter so that students can focus on their well-being.</li>
				<li>Students should not have to choose between wellness and their responsibilities. We will work to expand and improve the accessibility of wellness programming (like Norris Exam Relief, CAPS workshops, and student group events) by creating a coalition of relevant groups and departments to centralize planning and advertising of wellness events across campus.</li>
				<li>In addition to responsive programming like workshops and Exam Relief, we must also place an emphasis on proactive mental wellness. In order to shift campus culture, we will launch a campus-wide wellness campaign to encourage students to take time for themselves and for others by actively planning downtime into their schedules.</li>
				<li>We should not have to wait so long to get the help we need, and wait lists for counseling are not acceptable. We will mobilize students to demand an increase in CAPS staff and services, and educate students about alternative resources in the interim.</li>
				<br>
				<h3>Sexual Assault</h3>
				<li>It is important for survivors of sexual assault and violence to have access to all of their care and response options, such as confidential counseling or a conduct report. We will create sexualassault.northwestern.edu to eliminate barriers to information and serve as the first stop for survivors looking to find resources, seek support, or report a concern. We will also create an online form where students can submit questions and receive answers from administrators--and more importantly, from students--in order to increase transparency of the university process. </li>
				<li>Peer intervention is a critical component in making campus safer. But not everyone knows when or how to proactively intervene, or how to respond when sexual violence has already occurred. We will use the ASG student group committees to connect interested student groups with resources and training from organizations such as MARS, SHAPE, HPAW and CARE.</li>
				<br>
				<h3>Alcohol Policy</h3>
				<li>Student well-being should be the greatest priority for any alcohol policy. We will push for a change to the Responsible Action Protocol so that callers and callees receive full amnesty and no one is punished for doing the right thing.</li>
				<li>Late-night, alcohol-free programming has been shown to reduce unsafe drinking behavior on college campuses. We will create a grant program for students and groups to plan late-night events during the off weeks of NU Nights programming.</li>

				<h1><a class="roll-link" name="community">Build Up: Inclusive Community</a></h1>
				<li>We will strive for a more critically engaged and inclusive community that is intentional about the kinds of dialogue that take place on campus, and we will work to create more spaces for these positive interactions to occur. The creation of a US-based Social Inequalities and Diversities Requirement in all six schools is crucial to this effort. This academic requirement would equip more students to foster an inclusive community outside of the classroom and reduce the unfair burden on marginalized students to educate others on their identities.</li>
				<li>Dialogue is important and necessary in order to gain new perspectives, but it can't stop there if we are to build a better, more critically engaged campus community. To that end, we will implement student leader trainings to begin this culture shift. We will also set aside ASG funds so that ideas such as group collaborations, new programs and campus events may become tangible realities. </li>
				<li>As if tuition wasn’t enough, the cost of course materials and other educational experiences can be discouragingly high. We will push administration to 1) subsidize class materials such as textbooks, supplies, laptops, and software for students who identify as low-income and 2) Increase aid for summer programs such as study abroad, Engage Chicago, and GESI to ensure that cost does not restrict educational opportunities.</li>
				<li>Access can make a big difference. We will work with Wildcat Welcome, the newly created Office of Student Enrichment Services, and student groups to better incorporate resources for students from low-income backgrounds before and during Wildcat Welcome. This will help to increase awareness of available resources and opportunities, and create a foundation for implementing new services, like funding for laptops and class materials.</li>
				<li>Academic advisors should know about more than just what happens in the classroom. We will work to increase training so that advisors are well-versed in opportunities such as scholarships and academic workshops to better support underrepresented students.</li>
				<li>Student events are at the heart of every Northwestern experience, and cost should never be a barrier to attend. We will work to increase the accessibility of campus events for students with financial need by creating a WildCARD scanner check-out program so that groups can accept vouchers and meal plan Cat Cash for event tickets.</li>
				<li>Living on-campus is a formative period for everyone, and students of all gender identities should have the option of living in a gender-open room in any building on campus.</li>

			<div class="text-box">
				<h1><a class="roll-link" name="studentgroups">Build Up: Student Groups</a></h1>
				<li>Joining a student group should not be so complicated. We will make the experience easier by developing a ‘Common App’ for recruitment and connecting students who are seeking involvement with groups that match their interests. </li>
				<li>Planning events is hard work, and we want to streamline the process. We will create a one-stop-shop website where student group leaders can find information about funding, access a centralized event calendar, and download resource guides just for them.</li>
				<li>Implementing a digital SOFO system will relieve 	burdens on student leaders. We envision a future where treasurers can submit transactions during non-business hours, advisors can approve requests online, and students can finally be reimbursed in a timely manner. This initiative may take more than one year, but we will work with SOFO to implement short-term changes (like online advisor approval) while a long-term system is designed and tested over the next year.</li>
				<li>Few people completely understand the way that groups are funded, and we will strive to make the process as transparent as possible. We will implement a new policy where Account Executives increase transparency and quality of reporting by mandating that post-event reports be shared with each group soon after an event occurs.</li>
				<li>Account and Group Executives are ASG’s first line of interaction with student groups. We will improve AE/GE training and cross-train these executives together to ensure all groups receive the same level of excellent support.</li>
