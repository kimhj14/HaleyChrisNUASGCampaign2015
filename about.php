			<p>Over the last three years, we’ve worked to build up all aspects of Northwestern by bringing students and communities together, because we know we can achieve more together than we can as individuals.</p>
			<p>Our leadership style and friendship has come from years of working together, starting with the addition of an Elder Hall shuttle stop during the fall quarter of our freshman year.</p>
			<p>Since then, each of our projects and initiatives (whether together or seperate) have only been successful because we were intentional about listening to student voices first and making it a priority to partner with different communities & groups:</p>
			<li>leading the It’s On Us campus campaign to end sexual assault (30+ student groups)</li>
			<li>hosting the largest-ever Global Village on Deering Meadow (30+ student groups)</li>
			<li>creating a stress-relief initiative and improving mental health resources (CAPS, NU Active Minds, NU Listens, Happiness Club)</li>
			<li>organizing the Deering Days Fall BBQ during Wildcat Welcome (IFC, PHA, RHA, RCB, DM, and 6 other student groups)</li>
			<li>developing new alcohol policies (IFC, SSDP)</li>
			<li>hundreds of residential facilities improvements (RHA & RCB)</li>
			<br>
			<p>Throughout our time in ASG, we’ve served as student representatives, advocates for campus safety and student wellness, ambassadors to the broader community, and mentors to younger leaders. In each role, we acted with the mindset that we are stronger together; that ASG is a partner to connect students, support student groups, and build up community.</p>

				<p>I’m a Medill and Weinberg junior and a native of Warsaw, Indiana. My time as Director of Campus Safety and Transportation for ASG and the President of Deering Days have been opportunities to unite with communities on campus and to learn how ASG can work with students to promote wellness and intentional community interaction at Northwestern.</p>
				<p>Through my campus experiences, I’ve made real progress and have had tangible wins in:</p>
					<li>constructive spaces for students to interact with student groups</li>
					<li>safety resources tailored to student needs</li>
					<li>sexual assault awareness and engagement among students and groups</li>
					<li>transportation options and routes that benefit students year-round</li>
					<li>communicating and improving relationships with Evanston neighbors</li>
					<li>group collaboration on student wellness issues</li>
				<p>Working with student groups and administrators in these areas has equipped me with the understanding and skills to advocate for students, recognize needs on campus, and connect communities and resources in meaningful ways.</p>

					<p>As a new student at Northwestern, I sought involvement and friendship in a variety of campus communities and before long I became enthusiastic about building those communities. Through these experiences, I found that many students often do not find a safe, constructive space available to them. At the same time, I’ve seen first-hand the amazing things that can happen when we approach one another with the mindset of genuine learning and understanding. Community isn’t easy to build, and it certainly doesn’t happen overnight, but I believe it’s worth the effort.</p>
					<p>One of my most formative campus experiences has been working on sexual violence awareness issues on campus, both through my sorority and as the Director of Campus Safety. I saw hundreds of students rally behind the idea of a safer campus when I led the It’s On Us campaign. I have personally felt the love and support of dozens of women in my sorority as we regularly discuss healthy love and raise money to support survivors of domestic violence here in Evanston.</p>
					<p>As president of Deering Days, I learned many lessons about student groups and their experiences at Northwestern. When we co-sponsored an event that featured over 30 student groups last Spring, I successfully pushed the administration to allow us to host an important community event in a community space after we were turned away from Deering Meadow repeatedly. This experience taught me that student leaders need ready access to resources, as well as advocates who can leverage within all levels of the administration.</p>
					<p>I’m not afraid to take a stand for what I believe is best for students, and I’ve done that countless times over the past three years through my work in my sorority, in Deering Days, and in ASG. Ultimately, I have learned that it is the quality and richness of an experience that makes something worthwhile for students, not the number of people who attend an event. As President of ASG, I would be committed to the these values. </p>

				<br>
				<p>I’m a SESP and Weinberg junior and a native of Papillion, Nebraska. Spending the last three years involved in different communities across campus, and the past year serving the student body as the Vice President for Student Life, has given me the unique opportunity to be at the front lines of what ASG is doing on campus and what needs to be done in the future. </p>
				<p>Through my campus experiences, I’ve made real progress and have had tangible wins in:</p>
					<li>mental health and campus stress culture</li>
					<li>sexual assault response and awareness</li>
					<li>student conduct and an alcohol policy that values well-being above all else</li>
					<li>therapy dogs, exam relief, and other wellness programming</li>
					<li>shuttle routes, frostbite shuttles, and tracking apps</li>
					<li>quality of dining halls and retail locations</li>
					<li>south campus fitness classes</li>
					<li>residential reservation process, package centers, and building improvements</li>
					<li>norris services, especially during Reading & Finals week</li>
				<p>And I attribute that progress to my ability to build relationships, empower others for success, and personally advocate for change at Northwestern.</p>

					<p>As a residential senator for two years, I learned that the best way to get things done at Northwestern is to build a broad, genuine base of support and to propose realistic ideas that actually improve students’ day-to-day lives and the Northwestern experience. It’s easy for administrators to overlook our ideas, but when we work together, they have to act.</p>
					<p>As the Vice President for Student Life,  I spend about 30 hours each week to oversee a committee of students and serve as the primary ASG liaison with dozens of campus administrators. Together, my 18 committee members and I work on projects pertaining to areas such as dining, mental health, and student conduct. My service on three ASG committees and in several other organizations has prepared me well to manage the day-to-day aspects of our Student Government.</p>
					<p>Freshman year when I first arrived on campus from a small town in Nebraska, I saw how students were perceived and treated in Evanston, and I realized that if we want to change that perception we have to show we care about our entire community. My work as the Director of Fundraising for LEND, a student-run non-profit microfinance group, has given me unique access and familiarity with city officials, business owners, and influential groups across Evanston.</p>
					<p>As a member of the Community Relations Committee for two years, I created an Evanston Engagement Grant, started a program for NU students to have dinner with Evanston families, and planned two housing fairs, among many other initiatives. LEND and Community Relations have improved Northwestern’s image, and being here feels much more like my hometown, which helps when we’re trying to make beneficial changes such as improving shuttle routes or expanding Big Bite Night.</p>
					<p>My work as Vice President of Deering Days, planning major campus events like the New Student Fall BBQ and Global Village, has given me first-hand experience with group funding, SOFO, and the myriad other challenges of campus programming. Through ASG, I’ve also worked closely with NU Active Minds, NU Listens, and Happiness Club to start a mental health campaign and plan exam-relief programming that has affected thousands of students.</p>
					<p>It’s experiences like these and others that have made me realize just how special and passionate our friends and classmate truly are. And that when we work together, our voices and our potential are unstoppable. Let’s Build Up each other, and then Build Up Northwestern.</p>
