		<h1>OUR COMMITMENT: A RESPONSIBLE ASG</h1>
		<br>
		<div class="commitment-text">
			<ul>
				<li>Too often, <b>ASG has focused on short term solutions that look good on resumes rather than fighting for difficult structural changes.</b> ASG’s agenda should be built around students -- not the administration or self-interest -- and we promise to challenge the university’s (and ASG’s) status quo to better meet the needs of all students and to ensure their voices are heard and respected in the process.</li>
				<li> Accordingly, we will demand that students sit on investment and budget planning committees so that we know how the university spends our money and sets forth academic and student affairs priorities. These student reprepresentatives will <b>work to ensure that the university takes an undergraduate-minded approach</b> to these issues in full consideration of student opinions and needs.</li>
				<li><b>We promise to build an ASG that the entire student body can trust.</b> This means making accountability a given in every aspect of the organization. We will create a twice-yearly review process to evaluate ourselves, our senators, and our executive board members, and to present these reviews and plans for improvement publicly to make sure we meet the standards you deserve.</li>
				<li><b>ASG exists to serve students first,</b> which means we can’t wait for you to come to us when you need help. We promise to keep ASG visible and accessible by: 
					<p>1) Attending hall munchies, chapter dinners, and student group exec and general member meetings each quarter.</p>
					<p>2) Holding bi-weekly coffee chats and quarterly forums to gather feedback on initiatives and share updates, and creating a public comment section at the beginning of every senate session where students can express their concerns.</p>
					<p>3) Appointing committee liaisons to contact every student group (not just those ASG funds) at least once per quarter to see if they have any needs.</p>
				</li>
